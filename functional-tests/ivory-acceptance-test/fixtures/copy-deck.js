This means that we will keep official records of your compliance history as evidence. For purposes of enforcing the Act, we may share your data with other parties including the police, customer officers and prosecuting services.\nWe will share your data when making an application for an exemption certificate so that an expert can determine whether they are able to assess your ivory item. A conflict of interest would stop them from assessing your ivory item.\nSuppose an expert is able to assess your ivory item (meaning that there is no conflict of interest on their part). In that case, they will also assess whether, in their view, the item meets the criteria of being a pre-1918 item of outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value.\nWe may also share details of your ivory item with a prospective buyer or hirer when they contact APHA with a submission reference or exemption certificate reference number. Sharing information helps buyers feel assured the item they intend to buy or hire out is either registered or certified.\nWith your consent, we will share with prescribed institutions:\ndetails of your ivory item (but not your name, contact details, or any other information identifying you) from your application for an exemption certificate\nthe Secretary of State’s decision on whether to award that an item an exemption certificate\nThis is to help further their expertise.There is no obligation for you to give your consent for this purpose, and it is entirely voluntary on your part.\nWhen you register or make an application for an exemption certificate to deal in an ivory item legally, we will use your data to send confirmation:\nof the registration for an item under the standard exemptions, or\nthat an application for a pre-1918 outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value item has been received\nof the outcome of an application for an exemption certificate to the applicant\nWe may also:\nContact you or someone acting on your behalf to request further information on the application\nContact you to tell you an application has been made on your behalf\nContact you if we suspect that any intent to deal in an ivory item does not comply with the Ivory Act 2018\ncheck that you or someone acting on your behalf when dealing in an ivory item complies with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\nThe legal basis for processing your data\nWhere APHA uses your data to help further an assessor’s expertise, the legal basis for this data-use is described in Article 6 (1) (a) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Article 6 (1) (a) relates to processing your data where you have freely and voluntarily given consent for your data to be used for that purpose.\nWhere APHA uses your data to check that the dealing of an ivory item complies with the Ivory Act 2018, the legal basis for this data use is described in Article 6 (1) (e) of the UK GDPR. Article 6 (1) (e) relates to the processing of your data necessary for the exercise of official authority vested in the controller (Defra and APHA).\nDefra and APHA are official authorities and make up a UK government department that has official responsibility for regulating the implementation and application of the Ivory Act 2018.\nConsent to process your data to help further the expertise of the prescribed institution\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time before your data is shared with an expert assessor to help them to further their expertise.\nA law-based requirement to provide personal data\nYou are required by law to provide your data to APHA so they can ensure that any dealing of your ivory item is compliant with the Ivory Act 2018. When the ban on dealing in ivory items commences in Spring 2022, there will be a statutory requirement under section 10 (1) and section 3 (1) of the Ivory Act 2018 for you to provide your personal data.\nWhat happens if you do not provide the necessary data?\nWithout necessary data, we will not be able to process your registration or an application for an exemption certificate. Once the ivory ban comes into force in Spring 2022, you will not be able to deal in the ivory to which your application refers.\nWho Defra and APHA share your data with\nWe will share your data with the assessor who assesses the application to give their expert opinion on whether the item meets the exemption criteria. In this case, data sharing applies only to applications relating to pre-1918 items that are of outstandingly high artistic, cultural or historical value.\nYour personal data is shared with expert assessors so they can feel assured that there is no conflict of interest. For example, if a potential assessor were related to an applicant, which would lead to a conflict of interest, that assessor would not assess that applicant’s ivory item. Instead, we will share your application and personal details with an assessor that does not have conflicting interests.\nWe will not share your data with any other third parties, except where we are required to do so by law or court order, to detect or prevent crime, or to apprehend or prosecute offenders.\nStoring data outside the UK\nPersonal data may be stored or hosted in Ireland.\nHow long Defra and APHA hold personal data\nUnder the Ivory Act 2018, there is a statutory requirement for us to hold data on ivory items where an applicant has made a registration or applied for an exemption certificate. This registration or application would have been under the provisions governing exemptions in the Act.\nPersonal data will be held for seven years from the date we receive your application. It will be reviewed to determine whether a further retention period is required to ensure compliance with and appropriate enforcement of the Ivory Act. Data will be manually deleted once it has been determined it is appropriate to do so.\nYour rights\nFind out about your rights under the GDPR, The Data Protection Act 2018.\nComplaints\nYou have the right to make a complaint about the use of your data at any time. Make a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO – the data protection supervisory authority).\nDefra’s Personal Information Charter\nDefra’s Personal Information Charter, which also applies to APHA’s use of personal data, explains more about your rights over your data. This Charter broadly sets out Defra’s standards for requesting or storing personal information.",
